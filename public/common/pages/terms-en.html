By clicking on the &ldquo;Place Order&rdquo; button, Lessee agrees to be bound by these Terms and Conditions, and confirms that Lessee has read them. Lessor may at its sole discretion modify these Terms and Conditions at any time and any modifications shall become effective immediately as posted on this site. By clicking on the &ldquo;Place Order&rdquo; button, Lessee indicates acceptance of the modified Terms and Conditions. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and promises hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows: </span></p>
<p><strong>1. Basis of Agreement. </strong></p>
<p><span>Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify Lessor&rsquo;s acceptance of Lessee&rsquo;s order, nor does it constitute confirmation of Lessor&rsquo;s offer to rent. Grover reserves the right at any time after receipt of Lessee&rsquo;s order to accept or decline Lessee&rsquo;s order or to supply less than the quantity Lessee ordered of any item for any reason. Where hire of the Equipment is to a Customer who is an individual and the hire would be covered by the Consumer Credit Act 1974 the duration of the Rental Period shall not exceed 3 months, after which time the Lease shall be deemed to have automatically terminated. Accordingly the hire of any Equipment is not covered by the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Nothing in this Lease shall exclude or limit any statutory rights of the Customer which may not be excluded or limited due to the Customer acting as a consumer. Where the Customer is acting as a consumer any provision which is marked with an asterisk (*) may, subject to determination by the Courts or any applicable legislation, have no force or effect and if any provision is under the applicable law of the Lease unenforceable in whole or in part or shall have no force or effect the Lease shall be deemed not to include such provisions but this shall not effect the enforceability of the remainder of the Lease. For further information about your statutory rights contact your local authority Trading Standards Department or Citizens Advice Bureau or if based in the Republic of Ireland your local office of the Director of Consumer Affairs or Citizens Information Centre. Lessor hereby leases to Lessee, and Lessee hereby leases from Lessor, the following described equipment (the "Equipment"): shown in the order summary upon checkout. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>2. Term.</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>The term of this Lease shall commence on the day of the first attempt by the parcel carrier to deliver the item, and expire on the last day of the rental. The Equipment must be return shipped to Grover on the last day of the rental. In the event the last day is a postal holiday, a shipping extension to the next delivery working day is granted. The rental period ends the moment the Equipment are confirmed in the carriers possession. Until the Equipment is shipped back and is confirmed in the carriers possession, Lessee will be held liable and. If the Lease does not show up as tracked with the carrier, Lessee will be liable for the cost to replace the Equipment, or the late fees once the package begins to track with the carrier, as stated further below on the personal liability of Lessee for the Equipment. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>3. Shipping.</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Lessee is responsible for the payment for the shipping of the Equipment to Lessee&rsquo;s premises and back to Grover. Lessor does not ship on bank holidays. Lessor will send Lessee an email at the email address Lessee has provided when Equipment is shipped. Lessor will send Lessee an email at the email address Lessee has provided when Equipment rented by Lessee is returned. Lessor cannot guarantee when an order will arrive. Consider any shipping or transit time offered by Grover only as an estimate. Lessee is encouraged to order in a timely fashion to avoid delays caused by shipping or product availability. Both the outbound (from Lessor to Lessee&rsquo;s premises) and inbound (from Lessee back to Lessor) shipping charges for the order will be paid in advance and in full by Lessee, unless explicitly specified otherwise. Use of shipping or delivery methods other than those arranged for or specified by the Lessor constitutes a violation of these terms. Said violation may </span></p>

<p><span>result in the application of penalties/late fees as applicable. The Lessee is responsible for bringing the package(s) to an authorized shipping location and having the package scanned. Furthermore the Lessee agrees to obtain a receipt for the transaction which shall be retained until Lessor notifies the Lessee that their rental is complete. Dropping the package(s) off in a drop-box, an un- staffed facility, 3rd party shipper, mailroom facility, or any other facility DOES NOT constitute a safe return of Grover&rsquo;s property and constitutes a violation of the terms of the Lease. Any loss occurred at the above listed unauthorized facilities will be entirely the responsibility of the Lessee. Any loss will be calculated at full retail value plus any resulting loss of use charges. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>4. Rent and Payment.</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>The rent for the Equipment shall be paid in advance in full for any rental period as specified on the website (typically 1 month in advance for a 1 month period). If the Customer fails to make any payment in full on the due date the Lessor may charge the Customer interest (both before and after judgment/decree) on the amount unpaid at the rate implied by law under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 (where applicable) or at the rate of 4% above the base rate from time to time of the Lessor&rsquo;s bank whichever is higher. The Customer shall pay all sums due to the Lessor under this Lease without any set-off, deduction, counterclaim and/or any other withholding of monies. The Lessor may also choose to charge an administration fee of &pound;20 per week for every week that the invoice remains unpaid, in addition to the ongoing outstanding rent charges. The Lessor may set a reasonable credit limit for the Customer. The Lessor reserves the right to terminate or suspend the Lease for hire of the Equipment and/or the provision of Services if allowing it to continue would result in the Customer exceeding its credit limit or the credit limit is already exceeded. The Lessor reserves the right to store the Customer&rsquo;s credit card details on its password protected customer account system and further reserves the right to use such details against future Rentals made by the Customer. The Lessor also reserves the right to use the details to offset against any losses, damages or unpaid rental. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>5. Cancellations.</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Cancellations are made by contacting us via phone or e-mail and are subject to the following terms: Cancellation by Lessee of 24 hours or more before rental period is about to commence will result in no charge. Cancellation by Lessee of 24 hours or less before rental period is about to commence is not allowed, and will result in full charge. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>6. Use.</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Lessee shall use the Equipment in a careful and proper manner and shall comply with and conform to all national, state, municipal, police and other laws, ordinances and regulations in any way relating to the possession, use, or maintenance of the Equipment. Lessor is in no way responsible for Lessee's use of the Equipment and shall be indemnified by Lessee for any legal action resulting from Lessee's use of the Equipment, as explained in Sections [XX] and [XX] below. In particular, Customer shall: not remove any labels from and/or interfere with the Equipment, their working mechanisms or any other parts of them and shall take reasonable care of the Equipment and only use them for their proper purpose in a safe and correct manner in accordance with any operating and/or safety instructions provided or supplied to the Customer; take adequate and proper measures to protect the Equipment from theft, damage and/or other risks; notify the Lessor of any change of its address and upon the Lessor&rsquo;s request provide details of the location of the Equipment; keep the Equipment at all times in its sole possession and not re-rent, lend or otherwise give away to any third party and is directly responsible for any conducts by such a third party in relation to the Equipment be responsible for the conduct and cost of any testing, examinations and/or checks in relation to the Equipment required by any legislation, best practice and/or operating instructions except to the extent that the Lessor has agreed to provide them as part of any Services; return the Equipment in good working order and condition (fair wear and tear excepted) and in a clean condition together with all other documents and accessories relating to the Equipment Should the Equipment be returned in the same classified condition as received and as acknowledged by the Lessor, Customer shall be entitled to accrued discounts or benefits as specified by Lessor in relation to each rental payment and the contract term. </span></p>

<p><span><strong>7. Right to Lease.</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Lessor warrants that Lessor has the right to lease the Equipment, as provided in this Lease. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>8. Ownership.</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>The Equipment provided for rental, is, and shall at all times be and remain, the sole and exclusive property of Lessor; and the Lessee shall have no right, title or interest therein or thereto except as expressly set forth in this Lease. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>9. Repairs.</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Lessor shall keep the Equipment in good repair, condition and working order and shall furnish any and all parts, mechanisms and devices required to keep the Equipment in good mechanical working order. Lessee shall not in any way repair or materially alter the physical or otherwise makeup of the Equipment. If Lessee does not comply with the above mentioned, and damage waiver is purchased on the rental item, damage waiver becomes void. </span></p>
<p><strong>10. Lost, Damaged, or Unreturned Equipment.</strong></p>
<p><span>Lessee hereby assumes and shall bear the entire risk of loss and damage to the Equipment from any and every cause. No loss or damage to the Equipment or any part thereof shall impair any obligation of Lessee under this Lease which shall continue in full force and effect through the term of the Lease. In the event of damage of any kind to the Equipment, Lessee agrees to allow Lessor to charge Lessee&rsquo;s credit card for the full cost of repair of said damaged Equipment. Lessor expressly reserves the right to choose the repair method and venue, within reasonable market value terms. Lessee and Lessor agree to be bound, legally and otherwise, by the report of Lessor&rsquo;s chosen repair venue as to the cause of the damage to the Equipment. Lessee will also allow Lessor to charge Lessee's credit card for loss of use fees in the event a damage waiver is not purchased on the parent rental order. Loss of use fees are the equivalent to an extension rate for the duration the equipment. In the event of Equipment becoming damaged beyond repair, Lessees shall pay for a full replacement and shall not be entitled to ownership of the damaged Equipment. In the unlikely event that the Equipment appears damaged when Lessee receives Equipment via shipment contractor, Lessee must notify Lessor immediately within three hours of receiving the shipment. Upon notification of suspected damage resulting from shipping of the Equipment, Lessor will send Equipment to the manufacturer for inspection and repair. Lessee and Lessor agree to be bound, legally and otherwise, by the report of manufacturer. In the event of default, or a lost or unreturned item, Lessor reserves the right to pursue civil and criminal remedies against Lessee, including, but not limited to, taking immediate possession of the Equipment; obtaining, by Lessee&rsquo;s credit card or otherwise, from Lessee the cost of the full retail price of a comparable substitute of Equipment and late fees assessed prior to deeming the Lessee in default or the Equipment lost or unreturned; notifying a collections agency, which immediately results in additional attorneys&rsquo; and collection fees being charged to Lessor; filing of criminal charges; employing &ldquo;skip tracer&rdquo;, private investigator, or repossession agency to collect the Equipment or goods sufficient to repay the value of the Equipment; and/or pursue any and all legal remedies against Lessee. Lessee will also forfeit all rights enumerated in the Privacy Policy of Lessor. These remedies are not exclusive.In the event of litigation to recover any such damages, Lessee is held responsible for all legal fees and costs incurred by Lessor. Lessor is deemed to be in &ldquo;default&rdquo; if for any reason payment to Lessee is not delivered, is disputed, or is otherwise interrupted. Equipment is deemed to be &ldquo;lost&rdquo; or &ldquo;unreturned&rdquo; when Lessee has failed to ship rented Equipment to Lessor within three (3) days of expiration of Term. If Lessee returns Equipment, in undamaged state, to Lessor within fifteen (15) days of expiration of Term, the charge to Lessee&rsquo;s credit card for the price of a comparable substitute will be refunded to Lessee by Lessor and a late fee will be charged to Lessee&rsquo;s credit card. Late returns are subject to a fee of twice the daily rental rate at the time of rental, for each day the Equipment is late. Returning an item late without notifying us first may cause Loss of Use fees to be applied in addition to the late fees. The amount of the Loss of Use fees will be calculated on a case-by-case basis. After fifteen (15) days, all sales are final. The Lessor will not be held liable for any damage to the Lessee&rsquo;s own or personal equipment used in conjunction with the Lessor&rsquo;s Equipment. </span></p>

<p><span><strong>11. Out-of-Stock Products and Multiple Product Orders.</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Lessor will ship product as it becomes available. There may be times when the product Lessee ordered is out-of-stock which will delay fulfilling Lessee&rsquo;s order. Lessor makes no guarantees as to availability of Equipment. Any estimate of availability provided by Lessor is based on the assumption that each Grover customer returns Equipment within the prescribed term period. Lessor will keep Lessee informed of any products that Lessee has ordered that are out-of-stock and unavailable for immediate shipment. If Equipment is out-of-stock or unavailable, Lessee may cancel the order at any time prior to shipping. For a multiple product order, Lessor will make every attempt to ship all products contained in the order at the same time. Products that are unavailable at the time of shipping will be shipped as they become available, unless Lessee notifies Lessor of their alternate wishes to this end. Lessee will only be charged for products contained in a given shipment, plus any applicable shipping charges. Lessee will only be charged for shipping at the rate quoted on Lessee&rsquo;s purchase receipt. The entirety of this shipping charge may be applied to the first product(s) shipped on an order requiring multiple shipments. </span></p>
<p><strong>12. Surrender</strong><span><strong>.</strong><br /> Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease, Lessee shall return the Equipment to Lessor in good repair, condition and working order, ordinary wear and tear resulting from proper use thereof alone excepted, by delivering the Equipment at Lessee's cost and expense via the shipping method of Lessor's choice. Ordinary wear and tear is to be determined at the discretion of the Lessor within the confines of the reasonably common and ordinary meanings of those terms. Lessee will be responsible for proper packaging of the return shipment using shipping and packaging materials as provided by Lessor in the order shipment. Lessor&rsquo;s acceptance of the Equipment upon return by Lessee shall not represent Lessor&rsquo;s determination as to condition of Equipment upon return. Lessor reserves the right to accept Equipment upon return by Lessee and make determinations regarding the condition of the Equipment within a reasonable amount of time. Lessor&rsquo;s determination as to the condition of the Equipment upon return by Lessee is binding under this Section and Section 10 (&ldquo;Lost, Damaged, or Unreturned Equipment.&rdquo;). </span></p>
<p><span><strong>13. Damage Waiver.</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Grover offers Lessee the option to purchase a damage waiver for unintentional damage to the Equipment during the Rental Period. The determination of whether damage is unintentional and not abuse is at the sole discretion of Grover. In the event of damage covered by a damage waiver, the insured Lessee will pay Grover a deductible amounting to [50%] of the value of a new item as the Equipment rented to Lessee. Valuation of the Equipment is within the sole discretion of Grover. A damage waiver does not cover lost or stolen items. A damage waiver does not cover water damage as that is considered to fall under the category of Lessee negligence. Also, any peripheral items in Lessee's rental are not covered including lens hoods, battery chargers, front and rear caps, cables, etc. If Lessee loses and/or damages these items, Lessee will need to pay for them to be replaced even if Lessee purchases a damage waiver. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>14. Taxes.</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Lessee shall keep the Equipment free and clear of all levies, liens and encumbrances. Lessee, or Lessor at Lessee's expense, shall report, pay and discharge when due all license and registration fees, assessments, sales, use and property taxes, gross receipts, taxes arising out of receipts from use or operation of the Equipment, and other taxes, fees and governmental charges similar or dissimilar to the foregoing, together with any penalties or interest thereon, imposed by any state, federal or local government or any agency, or department thereof, upon the Equipment or the purchase, use, operation or leasing of the Equipment or otherwise in any manner with respect thereto and whether or not the same shall be assessed against or in the name of Lessor or Lessee. However, Lessee shall not be required to pay or discharge any such tax or assessment so long as it shall, in good faith and by appropriate legal proceedings, contest the validity thereof in any reasonable manner which will not affect or endanger the title and interest of Lessor to the Equipment; provided, Lessee shall reimburse Lessor for any damages or expenses resulting from such failure to pay or discharge. </span></p>
